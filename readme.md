# House Price Prediction Project

This project aims to predict house prices in Bengaluru city using machine learning techniques and provide an interactive web interface for users to explore predictions visually.

## Project Overview

The project consists of several components:

1. **Machine Learning Model**: 
   - Trained using historical housing data from Bengaluru.
   - Predicts house prices based on various features like location, size, amenities, etc.

2. **Web Interface**:
   - Built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript (including libraries like D3.js for visualization).
   - Users can input features of a house (e.g., location, area, number of rooms) through a form.
   - Sends this data to the server for prediction.

3. **Server-side Scripting**:
   - Utilizes Python with Flask or Django framework (or any other preferred server-side language) to handle:
     - Receiving input data from the web interface.
     - Calling the machine learning model for prediction.
     - Sending the predicted price back to the web interface.

4. **Visualization**:
   - Uses JavaScript (e.g., D3.js, Chart.js) to visualize:
     - Predicted house prices on a map of Bengaluru.
     - Trends in house prices based on different features (optional).

## Folder Structure

```
- /data
  - Contains dataset used for training the machine learning model.
- /models
  - Stores trained machine learning models.
- /src
  - /frontend
    - HTML, CSS, JS files for the web interface.
  - /backend
    - Server-side scripts (Flask, Django, etc.) for handling requests and integrating with the ML model.
- README.md
  - Documentation about the project, setup instructions, usage guide, etc.
```

## Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**
   - Make sure you have Python installed.
   - Install required Python packages using pip:
     ```bash
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```

3. **Run the Application:**
   - Start the server:
     ```bash
     python app.py
     ```
   - Open the web interface in a browser:
     ```
     http://localhost:5000
     ```

## Usage

- Fill out the form on the web interface with relevant details about a house.
- Click 'Predict' to see the estimated price for the house based on the machine learning model.
- Explore visualizations (if implemented) to understand house price trends in different areas of Bengaluru.
